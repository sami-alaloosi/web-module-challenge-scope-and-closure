# Scope and Closure Challenge

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## JavaScript Foundations

## Scope and Closures

## Objectives

- Explain function scope
- Describe what closure is, how closure is created in a program and why it is important to understand closures in JavaScript  

## Introduction

This challenge focuses on both scope and closures.

In this challenge you will be working to build a `scoreboard` (in the console) that takes randomly generated data and keeps track of a game's progress. If you're not familiar with the rules of baseball what you need to know is this: there are 9 innings and teams take turns "at-bat." Teams can only score while they are at bat. A team stops being at bat once they have gotten 3 `outs` by either striking out or through game play. You can read more about baseball rules [here](https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/baseball.html).

A scoreboard in a major league stadium looks something like this. In fact, the scoreboard at Fenway Park in Boston is actually quite famous.

There are layers upon layers of nested functions within the game of baseball. Your challenge today will be to work through tasks associated with these layers, and ultimately to produce a scoreboard that logs in the console.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set Up Project and Tests

1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github
2. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!)
3. `cd` into your newly cloned repository
4. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`
5. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual

### Task 2a - MVP code

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks.

### Task 2b - Written questions

Edit the `ReadMe` file with your answers.

1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).
A closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.
2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name){
  return function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");


dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?

Line 53 when the function accessed the name variable from outside the function's scope.

b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. What is always the same? What could change?

The name is always the same because it been defined outside the function' scope (the function only uses the name and doesnt manipulate it ).The newRoll number always change when we recall the functions because it been created inside the function.

c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`? 

newRoll will not be accessible outside the personalDice function.

### Task 2c - Exit Ticket

Once you begin, you will have 15 minutes to answer the questions [here](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/WjSzNh9gDrD8Xn8hw/enY3yPRP3nEm7E).

The completion of these questions is mandatory for MVP. However, passing the quiz doesn't affect your standing as a Lambda School student whatsoever. This is Lambda School testing itself! Please answer honestly and to the best of your ability without using external references.

### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

```js
(function(){
  var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
a in undefined; you can only use a inside the function scope.
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));
b = 3; you can use b anywhere in your code (b is defined in the global scope)
```

2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

```js
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27
```
//my answer

function createBase(n){
  return function(number){
    return n + number;
  }
}
var addSix = createBase(6);
console.log(addSix(10)); // returns 16
console.log(addSix(21)); // returns 27


3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!

In Object-oriented programming, it is really hard to maintain objects while increasing the levels of inheritance. It also breaks the principle of encapsulation and not fully modular even. In functional programming, it requires always a new object to execute functions and it takes a lot of memory for executing the applications.
